# Call-Center-Performance-Analysis-with-Power-BI

# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance of a call center using a dataset of 5000 entries.

We will utilize data visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in the call center's operations.


# Data Understanding


The dataset contains the following relevant variables:


**Agent:** The name of the agent who handled the call.


**Call Answered:** Whether the call was answered (Y/N).


**Speed of Answer:** Time taken to answer the call.


**Talk Duration:** Duration of the call.


**Customer Rating**: Customer satisfaction rating for the call.



# Exploratory Data Analysis

We will perform EDA to gain insights into the data and identify any potential issues or anomalies.

**Key Questions:**


**What is the overall call volume and distribution?**

**How many calls are answered and unanswered?**

**What is the average speed of answer and talk duration?**

**How does customer satisfaction vary across agents?**

**Are there any trends in call volume and agent performance over time?**

**Agent Performance**

Stewart appears to be the most active agent, handling a significant number of calls.

The table on the right provides a detailed breakdown of each agent's performance, including the number of answered 

and unanswered calls, average speed of answer, and average talk duration.

There are peaks and troughs in the call volume throughout the day, indicating periods of higher and lower demand.

**Customer Satisfaction**

The average customer rating is 3.40 out of a possible 5.

This suggests that there is room for improvement in customer satisfaction.

# Recommendations

Based on the dashboard, here are some recommendations to improve call center performance:

**Reduce Unanswered Calls:**

Increase staffing levels during peak hours.

Implement call queuing and automatic call distribution (ACD) systems.

Train agents on effective call handling techniques to reduce call handling time.


**Improve Speed of Answer:**


Monitor agent performance and provide training to improve response times.


Optimize call routing and queuing systems.


**Enhance Customer Satisfaction:**

Implement customer satisfaction surveys and feedback mechanisms.


Train agents on effective communication and problem-solving skills.


Provide agents with the necessary tools and resources to handle customer inquiries efficiently.


**Analyze Call Data:**

Use data analytics to identify trends and patterns in call data, such as peak hours, common issues, and agent performance metrics.


Use this information to optimize staffing levels, improve agent training, and enhance customer experience.


# Conclusion

By analyzing the call center data, we can gain valuable insights into the performance of agents, identify areas for improvement,

and optimize operations. Data-driven insights can help to improve customer satisfaction, reduce call wait times, and increase agent efficiency.
